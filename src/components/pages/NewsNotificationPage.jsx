        "Under the Clean Sri Lanka Program, construction began on the first of seven small coastal parks planned for the Puttalam District. The inaugural site, located near the Kurusa Church in Marawila, was officially launched on October 4. This initiative is part of a broader national project to establish 100 coastal parks across the country. The launch event was organized by the Department of Coast Conservation and attended by Deputy Minister of Environment Anton Jayakody, along with local MPs and officials. These new parks will be developed in areas including Kalpitiya, Puttalam, Marawila, and Chilaw to enhance coastal preservation and promote eco-tourism.",
